This site is created for providing developers frequently-used blockchain-related functions(tools) easily.
<br />
All functions listed in this site doesn't use external network API.  They even could be used without a network connection.  
<br />
Even so, I recommend not to type your private information, for example, your real private key. You should always be careful of your browser is safe from being hacked. (Some chrome extension can peek what you're typing.)  
<br />
If there is no function(tool) you're looking for, please let me know, or you could submit PR to following link:
